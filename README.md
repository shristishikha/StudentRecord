# StudentRecord

I have made a mini project named “Student Record”, which is used to maintain record of students like registration/enrollment number, name, father’s name, contact number 
and address, for now. But, it can be easily modified to store more details about students. 

Modules included in the project are “Add”, “Modify”, “Delete”, “Delete All”, “Show All records”, “Search Record by name or id”.  MySQL database system is used to store 
and fetch these details.
